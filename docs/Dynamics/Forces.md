## Newtons Laws
#### 1st Law (inertia):  
A body remains at rest, or in motion at a constant speed in a straight line, unless it is acted upon by a force.

#### 2nd law: 
$$F=ma$$
#### 3rd Law:
If two bodies exert forces on each other, these forces have the same magnitude but opposite directions.

### Gravity
on earth close to the ground,
$F_{g}=mg$
where,
$g=9.8\frac{m}{s^2}$
general formula,

$$F_{g}=\frac{Gm_{1}m_{2}}{r^2}$$
where the gravitational constant, $G=6.673 \times 10^{-11}\frac{m^3}{kg \ s^2}$

#### Normal Force
The force exerted opposing the compression of one object ![[a0ne8bch.png]]

#### Friction
##### Kinetic Friction
$$F_{k}=\mu_{k}N$$
where, $\mu_{k}$=coefficient of kinetic friction
##### Static Friction
$$F_{s} \leq \mu_{s}N$$ where, $\mu_{s}$=coefficient of static friction
