Energy is always conserved

$W=F\Delta x \ cos\theta$

where $\theta$ is the angle between the force F and the displacement $\Delta x$

or just

$W=F \Delta x$

if the force applied is parallel to the line of motion
##### Work-energy theorem
the work done on an object equals the change in kinetic energy of the object
$$W=\Delta K$$


#### Conservative Forces
- Does no net work on an object from one endpoint to the other, also can be defined as the work done by the conservative force does not depend on path for two given points.
- Ex: Gravity
#### Nonconservative Forces
- Ex: Friction

#### Work by a nonconstant force
$$W=\int F \ dx$$

#### Potential energy
$$\Delta U = -W$$

$$F=-\frac{dU}{dx}$$

### Power
Power is the rate at which work is done.
$$P=\frac{dW}{dt}=Fv$$

it has the units joules/second, watts or in SI base units $\frac{kg\ m^2}{s^3}$
